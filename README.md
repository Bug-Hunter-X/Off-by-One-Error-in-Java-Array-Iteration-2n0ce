This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error in Java when iterating over arrays. The `BuggyArray.java` file shows the erroneous code, while `CorrectedArray.java` provides the corrected version.  The error occurs due to an incorrect loop condition that causes the loop to iterate one index beyond the valid bounds of the array, leading to an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The solution involves carefully examining the loop termination condition to ensure it correctly handles the array's boundaries.
